Keyboard system:

When getting a key event, an integer Key is in the Event structure.
This integer has a specific format: 

the lower 16 bits (KeyCode&0xffff) is zero if this is not a printable keystroke. 
Otherwise, it represents the unicode of the _unmodified_ key on keyboard (for example
1 on an english keyboard even if shift+1 is pressed for excalmation mark)

The lower 20 bits represent all available keystrokes, even thoose not printable.
The supported unprintable keys is defined in class KeyCodes as constant integers.

In addition to this, the following combination of flags can be ored in the keycode in
any combination:
0x100000  => shift is pressed
0x200000  => control is pressed
0x400000  => alt is pressed


Example: check if control+a is pressed:
if(Event.Key=='A'+KeyCode.Control) {char ch=(char)(Event.Key&0xffff) /*ch is now the character of the key*/}

Example: check if this is a typable key:
if( (Event.Key&0xffff)!=0) { /*do something with the typable character*/}
